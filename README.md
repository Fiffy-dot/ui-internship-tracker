# Project: internship_tracker

## Sector: Education and Employment sector

## Problem Statement
It is essential for African Leadership University students to graduate with experience preferably industry experience. This is usually achieved through internships that they do through their undergraduate degree. However, navigating the internship application season can be difficult from finding the internships, applying, keeping track of different internships, and interviewing which mostly happens when school is in session.

## Solution Concept
The solution to this problem is an Internship Tracker managed by career development and the user. This Tracker helps students find different internships posted online, connects students to employers, and enables them to keep track of their different internships. The site would help them also see the conversion rate from applying to getting a full-time offer, aiding in identifying different areas they need to work on.

## Code Description
This the user interface part of the platform that helps the user interacts with the system.
